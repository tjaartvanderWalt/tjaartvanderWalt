## Hi there 👋

I am a human that likes to write programs.  
I don't mind writing programs for the  
frontend or for the backend (or the  
in-between). Recently I have been writing  
mostly in python, I have been writing C#  
in my sleep. I also write some TypeScript  
(JavaScript ???). For some reason I always  
get asked about CSS (even when I am neck  
deep in backend code), I guess I might be  
slightly better with CSS than the average  
developer, and I don't mind helping! As  
they say: in the land of the blind, the  
one-eyed man is king.  

You pronounce my name like a Chart 🗺️, Pie _Chaart_.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on python projects at [Wave](https://github.com/waveaccounting), specifically the receipts product and the accounting product. I also have some personal side projects written in C#.
